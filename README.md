# The Tower

A really simple (and visually strange) demonstration project for Voxelman.

PC only, needs GLES3. (I think it should run on GLES2 though, but never tried it.)

## Controls

`w`,`a`,`s`,`d`: Movement \
`space`: jump (you can also double jump) \
`shift`: run \
`r`: reload level \
`esc`: ingame menu
