# The Tower

A really simple (and visually strange) demonstration project for Voxelman.

In order to open this, you need to have a Godot built with [voxelman](https://github.com/Relintai/voxelman)!

Currently this will only work with [this revision](https://github.com/Relintai/voxelman/commit/52356411223144721fb1c68ccf1955c33bfec44b)
of voxelman. I'm hoping to update it soon to voxelman master.

# Pre-built binaries

You can grab a pre-built editor binary from the releases tab [[here]](https://github.com/Relintai/the_tower/releases).

This project is also loadable with older binaries from the [Broken Seals](https://github.com/Relintai/broken_seals) repo.

## Controls

`w`,`a`,`s`,`d`: Movement \
`space`: jump (you can also double jump) \
`shift`: run \
`r`: reload level \
`esc`: ingame menu

These sounds were made by Jute for DungeonHack. They are based on sounds from pdsounds.org.

I did modify the effect I use from it.
