# The Tower

A really simple (and visually strange) demonstration project for Voxelman.

PC only, needs GLES3. (I think it should run on GLES2 though, but never tried it.)

In order to open this, you need to have a Godot built with https://github.com/Relintai/voxelman !

# Pre-built binaries

You can grab a pre-built editor binary from the [Broken Seals](https://github.com/Relintai/broken_seals/releases) 
repo, should you want to. It contains all my modules.

## Controls

`w`,`a`,`s`,`d`: Movement \
`space`: jump (you can also double jump) \
`shift`: run \
`r`: reload level \
`esc`: ingame menu

These sounds were made by Jute for DungeonHack. They are based on sounds from pdsounds.org.

I did modify the effect I use from it.
